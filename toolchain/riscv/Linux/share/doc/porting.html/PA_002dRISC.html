<h4 class="subsection">1.1.4 PA-RISC Targets Supported</h4>

<p>This supports the various boards manufactured by the HP-PRO consortium. 
This is a group of companies all making variations on the PA-RISC
processor. Currently supported are ports to the WinBond &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Cougar</span></samp>&rsquo;
board based around their w89k version of the PA. Also supported is the
Oki op50n processor.

   <p>There is also included, but never built an unfinished port to the HP 743
board. This board is the main CPU board for the HP700 line of industrial
computers. This target isn't exactly an embedded system, in fact it's
really only designed to load and run HP-UX. Still, the crt0.S and I/O
code are fully working. It is included mostly because their is a barely
functioning exception handler GDB debug stub, and I hope somebody could
use it. The other PRO targets all use GDB's ability to talk to ROM
monitors directly, so it doesn't need a debug stub. There is also a
utility that will produce a bootable file by HP's ROM monitor. This is
all included in the hopes somebody else will finish it. :-)

   <p>Both the WinBond board and the Oki board download srecords. The WinBond
board also has support for loading the SOM files as produced by the
native compiler on HP-UX. WinBond supplies a set of DOS programs that
will allow the loading of files via a bidirectional parallel port. This
has never been tested with the output of GNU SOM, as this manual is
mostly for Unix based systems.
