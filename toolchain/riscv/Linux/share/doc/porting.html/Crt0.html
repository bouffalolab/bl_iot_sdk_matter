<h3 class="section">3.1 Crt0, the main startup file</h3>

<p>To make a program that has been compiled with GCC to run, you
need to write some startup code. The initial piece of startup code is
called a crt0. (C RunTime 0) This is usually written in assembler, and
it's object gets linked in first, and bootstraps the rest of the
application when executed. This file needs to do the following things.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Initialize anything that needs it. This init section varies. If you are
developing an application that gets download to a ROM monitor, then
there is usually no need for any special initialization. The ROM monitor
handles it for you.

     <p>If you plan to burn your code in a ROM, then the crt0 typically has to
do all the hardware initialization that is required to run an
application. This can include things like initializing serial ports or
run a memory check. It all depends on the hardware.

     <li>Zero the BSS section. This is for uninitialized data. All the addresses in
this section need to be initialized to zero so that programs that forget
to check new variables default value will get unpredictable results.

     <li>Call main()
This is what basically starts things running. If your ROM monitor
supports it, then first setup argc and argv for command line arguments
and an environment pointer. Then branch to main(). For G++ the the main
routine gets a branch to __main inserted by the code generator at the
very top.  __main() is used by G++ to initialize it's internal tables. 
__main() then returns back to your original main() and your code gets
executed.

     <li>Call exit()
After main() has returned, you need to cleanup things and return control
of the hardware from the application. On some hardware, there is nothing
to return to, especially if your program is in ROM.  Sometimes the best
thing to do in this case is do a hardware reset, or branch back to the
start address all over again.

     <p>When there is a ROM monitor present, usually a user trap can be called
and then the ROM takes over. Pick a safe vector with no side
effects. Some ROMs have a builtin trap handler just for this case.

portable between all the m68k based boards we have here.

<pre class="smallexample">     /* ANSI concatenation macros.  */
     
     #define CONCAT1(a, b) CONCAT2(a, b)
     #define CONCAT2(a, b) a ## b
</pre>
   <p>These we'll use later.

     /* Use the right prefix for global labels.  */
     #define SYM(x) CONCAT1 (__USER_LABEL_PREFIX__, x)
     
</pre>
   <p>These macros are to make this code portable between both <em>COFF</em> and
<em>a.out</em>. <em>COFF</em> always has an <var>_ (underline)</var> prepended on
the front of all global symbol names. <em>a.out</em> has none.

<pre class="smallexample">     #ifndef __REGISTER_PREFIX__
     #define __REGISTER_PREFIX__

</pre>
   <p>This is for portability between assemblers. Some register names have a
<var>%</var> or <var>$</var> prepended to the register name.

<pre class="smallexample">     /*
      * Set up some room for a stack. We just grab a chunk of memory.
      */
     	.set	stack_size, 0x2000
     	.comm	SYM (stack), stack_size
</pre>
   <p>Set up space for the stack. This can also be done in the linker script,
but it typically gets done here.

<pre class="smallexample">     /*
      * Define an empty environment.
      */
             .data
             .align 2
     SYM (environ):
             .long 0
</pre>
   <p>Set up an empty space for the environment. This is bogus on any most ROM
monitor, but we setup a valid address for it, and pass it to main. At
least that way if an application checks for it, it won't crash.

<pre class="smallexample">      	.align	2
     	.text
     	.global SYM (stack)
     
     	.global SYM (main)
     	.global SYM (exit)
     /*
      * This really should be __bss_start, not SYM (__bss_start).
      */
     	.global __bss_start
</pre>
   <p>Setup a few global symbols that get used elsewhere. <var>__bss_start</var>
needs to be unchanged, as it's setup by the linker script.

<pre class="smallexample">     /*
      * start -- set things up so the application will run.
      */
     SYM (start):
     	link	a6, #-8
     	moveal	#SYM (stack) + stack_size, sp
     
     /*
      * zerobss -- zero out the bss section
      */
     	moveal	#__bss_start, a0
     	moveal	#SYM (end), a1
     1:
     	movel	#0, (a0)
     	leal	4(a0), a0
     	cmpal	a0, a1
     	bne	1b
</pre>
   <p>The global symbol <code>start</code> is used by the linker as the default
address to use for the <code>.text</code> section. then it zeros the
<code>.bss</code> section so the uninitialized data will all be cleared. Some
programs have wild side effects from having the .bss section let
uncleared. Particularly it causes problems with some implementations of
<code>malloc</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     /*
      * Call the main routine from the application to get it going.
      * main (argc, argv, environ)
      * We pass argv as a pointer to NULL.
      */
             pea     0
             pea     SYM (environ)
             pea     sp@(4)
             pea     0
     	jsr	SYM (main)
     	movel	d0, sp@-
</pre>
   <p>Setup the environment pointer and jump to <code>main()</code>. When
<code>main()</code> returns, it drops down to the <code>exit</code> routine below.

<pre class="smallexample">     /*
      * _exit -- Exit from the application. Normally we cause a user trap
      *          to return to the ROM monitor for another run.
      */
     SYM (exit):
     	trap	#0
</pre>
   <p>Implementing <code>exit</code> here is easy. Both the <code>rom68k</code> and <code>bug</code>
can handle a user caused exception of <code>zero</code> with no side effects. 
Although the <code>bug</code> monitor has a user caused trap that will return
control to the ROM monitor, this solution has been more portable.
