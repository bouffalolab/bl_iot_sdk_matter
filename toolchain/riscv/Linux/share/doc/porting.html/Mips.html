<h4 class="subsection">1.1.3 Mips core Targets Supported</h4>

<p>The Crt0 startup file should run on any mips target that doesn't require
additional hardware initialization. The I/O code so far only supports a
custom LSI33k based RAID disk controller board. It should easy to
change to support the IDT line of eval boards. Currently the two
debugging protocols supported by GDB for mips targets is IDT's mips
debug protocol, and a customized hybrid of the standard GDB remote
protocol and GDB's standard ROM monitor support. Included here is the
debug stub for the hybrid monitor. This supports the LSI33k processor,
and only has support for the GDB protocol commands <code>g</code>, <code>G</code>,
<code>m</code>, <code>M</code>, which basically only supports the register and
memory reading and writing commands. This is part of libgloss and is
called lsi33k-stub.c.

   <p>The crt0.S should also work on the IDT line of eval boards, but has only
been run on the LSI33k for now. There is no I/O support for the IDT eval
board at this time. The current I/O code is for a customized version of
LSI's <code>pmon</code> ROM monitor. This uses entry points into the monitor,
and should easily port to other versions of the pmon monitor. Pmon is
distributed in source by LSI.
