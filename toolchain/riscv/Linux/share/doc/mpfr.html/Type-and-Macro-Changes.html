<h3 class="section">6.1 Type and Macro Changes</h3>

<!-- r6789 -->
<p>The official type for exponent values changed from <code>mp_exp_t</code> to
<code>mpfr_exp_t</code> in MPFR 3.0.  The type <code>mp_exp_t</code> will remain
available as it comes from GMP (with a different meaning).  These types
are currently the same (<code>mpfr_exp_t</code> is defined as <code>mp_exp_t</code>
with <code>typedef</code>), so that programs can still use <code>mp_exp_t</code>;
but this may change in the future. 
Alternatively, using the following code after including <samp><span class="file">mpfr.h</span></samp>
will work with official MPFR versions, as <code>mpfr_exp_t</code> was never
defined in MPFR 2.x:
<pre class="example">     #if MPFR_VERSION_MAJOR &lt; 3
     typedef mp_exp_t mpfr_exp_t;
     #endif
</pre>
   <p>The official types for precision values and for rounding modes
respectively changed from <code>mp_prec_t</code> and <code>mp_rnd_t</code>
to <code>mpfr_prec_t</code> and <code>mpfr_rnd_t</code> in MPFR 3.0.  This
change was actually done a long time ago in MPFR, at least since
MPFR 2.2.0, with the following code in <samp><span class="file">mpfr.h</span></samp>:
<pre class="example">     #ifndef mp_rnd_t
     # define mp_rnd_t  mpfr_rnd_t
     #endif
     #ifndef mp_prec_t
     # define mp_prec_t mpfr_prec_t
     #endif
</pre>
   <p>This means that it is safe to use the new official types
<code>mpfr_prec_t</code> and <code>mpfr_rnd_t</code> in your programs. 
The types <code>mp_prec_t</code> and <code>mp_rnd_t</code> (defined
in MPFR only) may be removed in the future, as the prefix
<code>mp_</code> is reserved by GMP.

<!-- r6787 -->
   <p>The precision type <code>mpfr_prec_t</code> (<code>mp_prec_t</code>) was unsigned
before MPFR 3.0; it is now signed.  <code>MPFR_PREC_MAX</code> has not changed,
though.  Indeed the MPFR code requires that <code>MPFR_PREC_MAX</code> be
representable in the exponent type, which may have the same size as
<code>mpfr_prec_t</code> but has always been signed. 
The consequence is that valid code that does not assume anything about
the signedness of <code>mpfr_prec_t</code> should work with past and new MPFR
versions. 
This change was useful as the use of unsigned types tends to convert
signed values to unsigned ones in expressions due to the usual arithmetic
conversions, which can yield incorrect results if a negative value is
converted in such a way. 
Warning!  A program assuming (intentionally or not) that
<code>mpfr_prec_t</code> is signed may be affected by this problem when
it is built and run against MPFR 2.x.

   <p>The rounding modes <code>GMP_RNDx</code> were renamed to <code>MPFR_RNDx</code>
in MPFR 3.0. However the old names <code>GMP_RNDx</code> have been kept for
compatibility (this might change in future versions), using:
<pre class="example">     #define GMP_RNDN MPFR_RNDN
     #define GMP_RNDZ MPFR_RNDZ
     #define GMP_RNDU MPFR_RNDU
     #define GMP_RNDD MPFR_RNDD
</pre>
   <p>The rounding mode &ldquo;round away from zero&rdquo; (<code>MPFR_RNDA</code>) was added in
MPFR 3.0 (however no rounding mode <code>GMP_RNDA</code> exists).
