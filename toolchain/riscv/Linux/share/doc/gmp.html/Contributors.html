<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Contributors</h2>

<p><a name="index-Contributors-950"></a>
Torbj&ouml;rn Granlund wrote the original GMP library and is still the main
developer.  Code not explicitly attributed to others, was contributed by
Torbj&ouml;rn.  Several other individuals and organizations have contributed
GMP.  Here is a list in chronological order on first contribution:

   <p>Gunnar Sj&ouml;din and Hans Riesel helped with mathematical problems in early
versions of the library.

   <p>Richard Stallman helped with the interface design and revised the first
version of this manual.

   <p>Brian Beuning and Doug Lea helped with testing of early versions of the
library and made creative suggestions.

   <p>John Amanatides of York University in Canada contributed the function
<code>mpz_probab_prime_p</code>.

   <p>Paul Zimmermann wrote the REDC-based mpz_powm code, the Sch&ouml;nhage-Strassen
FFT multiply code, and the Karatsuba square root code.  He also improved the
Toom3 code for GMP 4.2.  Paul sparked the development of GMP 2, with his
comparisons between bignum packages.  The ECMNET project Paul is organizing
was a driving force behind many of the optimizations in GMP 3.  Paul also
wrote the new GMP 4.3 nth root code (with Torbj&ouml;rn).

   <p>Ken Weber (Kent State University, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul)
contributed now defunct versions of <code>mpz_gcd</code>, <code>mpz_divexact</code>,
<code>mpn_gcd</code>, and <code>mpn_bdivmod</code>, partially supported by CNPq (Brazil)
grant 301314194-2.

   <p>Per Bothner of Cygnus Support helped to set up GMP to use Cygnus' configure. 
He has also made valuable suggestions and tested numerous intermediary
releases.

   <p>Joachim Hollman was involved in the design of the <code>mpf</code> interface, and in
the <code>mpz</code> design revisions for version 2.

   <p>Bennet Yee contributed the initial versions of <code>mpz_jacobi</code> and
<code>mpz_legendre</code>.

   <p>Andreas Schwab contributed the files <samp><span class="file">mpn/m68k/lshift.S</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">mpn/m68k/rshift.S</span></samp> (now in <samp><span class="file">.asm</span></samp> form).

   <p>Robert Harley of Inria, France and David Seal of ARM, England, suggested clever
improvements for population count.  Robert also wrote highly optimized
Karatsuba and 3-way Toom multiplication functions for GMP 3, and contributed
the ARM assembly code.

   <p>Torsten Ekedahl of the Mathematical department of Stockholm University provided
significant inspiration during several phases of the GMP development.  His
mathematical expertise helped improve several algorithms.

   <p>Linus Nordberg wrote the new configure system based on autoconf and
implemented the new random functions.

   <p>Kevin Ryde worked on a large number of things: optimized x86 code, m4 asm
macros, parameter tuning, speed measuring, the configure system, function
inlining, divisibility tests, bit scanning, Jacobi symbols, Fibonacci and Lucas
number functions, printf and scanf functions, perl interface, demo expression
parser, the algorithms chapter in the manual, <samp><span class="file">gmpasm-mode.el</span></samp>, and
various miscellaneous improvements elsewhere.

   <p>Kent Boortz made the Mac OS 9 port.

   <p>Steve Root helped write the optimized alpha 21264 assembly code.

   <p>Gerardo Ballabio wrote the <samp><span class="file">gmpxx.h</span></samp> C++ class interface and the C++
<code>istream</code> input routines.

   <p>Jason Moxham rewrote <code>mpz_fac_ui</code>.

   <p>Pedro Gimeno implemented the Mersenne Twister and made other random number
improvements.

   <p>Niels M&ouml;ller wrote the sub-quadratic GCD, extended GCD and jacobi code, the
quadratic Hensel division code, and (with Torbj&ouml;rn) the new divide and
conquer division code for GMP 4.3.  Niels also helped implement the new Toom
multiply code for GMP 4.3 and implemented helper functions to simplify Toom
evaluations for GMP 5.0.  He wrote the original version of mpn_mulmod_bnm1, and
he is the main author of the mini-gmp package used for gmp bootstrapping.

   <p>Alberto Zanoni and Marco Bodrato suggested the unbalanced multiply strategy,
and found the optimal strategies for evaluation and interpolation in Toom
multiplication.

   <p>Marco Bodrato helped implement the new Toom multiply code for GMP 4.3 and
implemented most of the new Toom multiply and squaring code for 5.0. 
He is the main author of the current mpn_mulmod_bnm1, mpn_mullo_n, and
mpn_sqrlo.  Marco also wrote the functions mpn_invert and mpn_invertappr,
and improved the speed of integer root extraction.  He is the author of
the current combinatorial functions: binomial, factorial, multifactorial,
primorial.

   <p>David Harvey suggested the internal function <code>mpn_bdiv_dbm1</code>, implementing
division relevant to Toom multiplication.  He also worked on fast assembly
sequences, in particular on a fast AMD64 <code>mpn_mul_basecase</code>. He wrote
the internal middle product functions <code>mpn_mulmid_basecase</code>,
<code>mpn_toom42_mulmid</code>, <code>mpn_mulmid_n</code> and related helper routines.

   <p>Martin Boij wrote <code>mpn_perfect_power_p</code>.

   <p>Marc Glisse improved <samp><span class="file">gmpxx.h</span></samp>: use fewer temporaries (faster),
specializations of <code>numeric_limits</code> and <code>common_type</code>, C++11
features (move constructors, explicit bool conversion, UDL), make the
conversion from <code>mpq_class</code> to <code>mpz_class</code> explicit, optimize
operations where one argument is a small compile-time constant, replace
some heap allocations by stack allocations.  He also fixed the eofbit
handling of C++ streams, and removed one division from <samp><span class="file">mpq/aors.c</span></samp>.

   <p>David S Miller wrote assembly code for SPARC T3 and T4.

   <p>Mark Sofroniou cleaned up the types of mul_fft.c, letting it work for huge
operands.

   <p>Ulrich Weigand ported GMP to the powerpc64le ABI.

   <p>(This list is chronological, not ordered after significance.  If you have
contributed to GMP but are not listed above, please tell
<a href="mailto:gmp-devel@gmplib.org">gmp-devel@gmplib.org</a> about the omission!)

   <p>The development of floating point functions of GNU MP 2, were supported in part
by the ESPRIT-BRA (Basic Research Activities) 6846 project POSSO (POlynomial
System SOlving).

   <p>The development of GMP 2, 3, and 4.0 was supported in part by the IDA Center
for Computing Sciences.

   <p>The development of GMP 4.3, 5.0, and 5.1 was supported in part by the Swedish
Foundation for Strategic Research.

   <p>Thanks go to Hans Thorsen for donating an SGI system for the GMP test system
environment.
