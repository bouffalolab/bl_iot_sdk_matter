<h4 class="subsection">15.2.3 Divide and Conquer Division</h4>

<p>For divisors larger than <code>DC_DIV_QR_THRESHOLD</code>, division is done by dividing. 
Or to be precise by a recursive divide and conquer algorithm based on work by
Moenck and Borodin, Jebelean, and Burnikel and Ziegler (see <a href="References.html#References">References</a>).

   <p>The algorithm consists essentially of recognising that a 2NxN division
can be done with the basecase division algorithm (see <a href="Basecase-Division.html#Basecase-Division">Basecase Division</a>),
but using N/2 limbs as a base, not just a single limb.  This way the
multiplications that arise are (N/2)x(N/2) and can take advantage of
Karatsuba and higher multiplication algorithms (see <a href="Multiplication-Algorithms.html#Multiplication-Algorithms">Multiplication Algorithms</a>).  The two &ldquo;digits&rdquo; of the quotient are formed by recursive
Nx(N/2) divisions.

   <p>If the (N/2)x(N/2) multiplies are done with a basecase multiplication
then the work is about the same as a basecase division, but with more function
call overheads and with some subtractions separated from the multiplies. 
These overheads mean that it's only when N/2 is above
<code>MUL_TOOM22_THRESHOLD</code> that divide and conquer is of use.

   <p><code>DC_DIV_QR_THRESHOLD</code> is based on the divisor size N, so it will be somewhere
above twice <code>MUL_TOOM22_THRESHOLD</code>, but how much above depends on the
CPU.  An optimized <code>mpn_mul_basecase</code> can lower <code>DC_DIV_QR_THRESHOLD</code> a
little by offering a ready-made advantage over repeated <code>mpn_submul_1</code>
calls.

   <p>Divide and conquer is asymptotically O(M(N)*log(N)) where
M(N) is the time for an NxN multiplication done with FFTs.  The
actual time is a sum over multiplications of the recursed sizes, as can be
seen near the end of section 2.2 of Burnikel and Ziegler.  For example, within
the Toom-3 range, divide and conquer is 2.63*M(N).  With higher
algorithms the M(N) term improves and the multiplier tends to log(N).  In practice, at moderate to large sizes, a 2NxN division
is about 2 to 4 times slower than an NxN multiplication.
