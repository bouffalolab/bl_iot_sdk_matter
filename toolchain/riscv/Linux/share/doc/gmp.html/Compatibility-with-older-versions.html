<h3 class="section">3.9 Compatibility with older versions</h3>

<p><a name="index-Compatibility-with-older-versions-186"></a><a name="index-Past-GMP-versions-187"></a><a name="index-Upward-compatibility-188"></a>
This version of GMP is upwardly binary compatible with all 5.x, 4.x, and 3.x
versions, and upwardly compatible at the source level with all 2.x versions,
with the following exceptions.

     <ul>
<li><code>mpn_gcd</code> had its source arguments swapped as of GMP 3.0, for consistency
with other <code>mpn</code> functions.

     <li><code>mpf_get_prec</code> counted precision slightly differently in GMP 3.0 and
3.0.1, but in 3.1 reverted to the 2.x style.

     <li><code>mpn_bdivmod</code>, documented as preliminary in GMP 4, has been removed. 
</ul>

   <p>There are a number of compatibility issues between GMP 1 and GMP 2 that of
course also apply when porting applications from GMP 1 to GMP 5.  Please
see the GMP 2 manual for details.

<!-- @item Integer division functions round the result differently.  The obsolete -->
<!-- functions (@code{mpz_div}, @code{mpz_divmod}, @code{mpz_mdiv}, -->
<!-- @code{mpz_mdivmod}, etc) now all use floor rounding (i.e., they round the -->
<!-- quotient towards -->
<!-- @ifinfo -->
<!-- @minus{}infinity). -->
<!-- @end ifinfo -->
<!-- @iftex -->
<!-- @tex -->
<!-- $-\infty$). -->
<!-- @end tex -->
<!-- @end iftex -->
<!-- There are a lot of functions for integer division, giving the user better -->
<!-- control over the rounding. -->
<!-- @item The function @code{mpz_mod} now compute the true @strong{mod} function. -->
<!-- @item The functions @code{mpz_powm} and @code{mpz_powm_ui} now use -->
<!-- @strong{mod} for reduction. -->
<!-- @item The assignment functions for rational numbers do no longer canonicalize -->
<!-- their results.  In the case a non-canonical result could arise from an -->
<!-- assignment, the user need to insert an explicit call to -->
<!-- @code{mpq_canonicalize}.  This change was made for efficiency. -->
<!-- @item Output generated by @code{mpz_out_raw} in this release cannot be read -->
<!-- by @code{mpz_inp_raw} in previous releases.  This change was made for making -->
<!-- the file format truly portable between machines with different word sizes. -->
<!-- @item Several @code{mpn} functions have changed.  But they were intentionally -->
<!-- undocumented in previous releases. -->
<!-- @item The functions @code{mpz_cmp_ui}, @code{mpz_cmp_si}, and @code{mpq_cmp_ui} -->
<!-- are now implemented as macros, and thereby sometimes evaluate their -->
<!-- arguments multiple times. -->
<!-- @item The functions @code{mpz_pow_ui} and @code{mpz_ui_pow_ui} now yield 1 -->
<!-- for 0^0.  (In version 1, they yielded 0.) -->
<!-- In version 1 of the library, @code{mpq_set_den} handled negative -->
<!-- denominators by copying the sign to the numerator.  That is no longer done. -->
<!-- Pure assignment functions do not canonicalize the assigned variable.  It is -->
<!-- the responsibility of the user to canonicalize the assigned variable before -->
<!-- any arithmetic operations are performed on that variable. -->
<!-- Note that this is an incompatible change from version 1 of the library. -->
<!-- @end enumerate -->
