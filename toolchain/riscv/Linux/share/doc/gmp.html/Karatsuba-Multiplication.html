<h4 class="subsection">15.1.2 Karatsuba Multiplication</h4>

<p><a name="index-Karatsuba-multiplication-902"></a>
The Karatsuba multiplication algorithm is described in Knuth section 4.3.3
part A, and various other textbooks.  A brief description is given here.

   <p>The inputs x and y are treated as each split into two parts of
equal length (or the most significant part one limb shorter if N is odd).

<pre class="example">      high              low
     +----------+----------+
     |    x1    |    x0    |
     +----------+----------+
     
     +----------+----------+
     |    y1    |    y0    |
     +----------+----------+
</pre>
   <p>Let b be the power of 2 where the split occurs, i.e. if x0 is
k limbs (y0 the same) then
b=2^(k*mp_bits_per_limb). 
With that x=x1*b+x0 and y=y1*b+y0, and the
following holds,

<pre class="display">     x*y = (b^2+b)*x1*y1 - b*(x1-x0)*(y1-y0) + (b+1)*x0*y0
</pre>
   <p>This formula means doing only three multiplies of (N/2)x(N/2) limbs,
whereas a basecase multiply of NxN limbs is equivalent to four
multiplies of (N/2)x(N/2).  The factors (b^2+b) etc represent
the positions where the three products must be added.

<pre class="example">      high                              low
     +--------+--------+ +--------+--------+
     |      x1*y1      | |      x0*y0      |
     +--------+--------+ +--------+--------+
               +--------+--------+
           add |      x1*y1      |
               +--------+--------+
               +--------+--------+
           add |      x0*y0      |
               +--------+--------+
               +--------+--------+
           sub | (x1-x0)*(y1-y0) |
               +--------+--------+
</pre>
   <p>The term (x1-x0)*(y1-y0) is best calculated as an
absolute value, and the sign used to choose to add or subtract.  Notice the
sum high(x0*y0)+low(x1*y1) occurs twice, so it's possible to do 5*k limb
additions, rather than 6*k, but in GMP extra function call overheads
outweigh the saving.

   <p>Squaring is similar to multiplying, but with x=y the formula reduces to
an equivalent with three squares,

<pre class="display">     x^2 = (b^2+b)*x1^2 - b*(x1-x0)^2 + (b+1)*x0^2
</pre>
   <p>The final result is accumulated from those three squares the same way as for
the three multiplies above.  The middle term (x1-x0)^2 is now
always positive.

   <p>A similar formula for both multiplying and squaring can be constructed with a
middle term (x1+x0)*(y1+y0).  But those sums can exceed
k limbs, leading to more carry handling and additions than the form
above.

   <p>Karatsuba multiplication is asymptotically an O(N^1.585<!-- /@w -->) algorithm,
the exponent being log(3)/log(2), representing 3 multiplies
each 1/2 the size of the inputs.  This is a big improvement over the
basecase multiply at O(N^2) and the advantage soon overcomes the extra
additions Karatsuba performs.  <code>MUL_TOOM22_THRESHOLD</code> can be as little
as 10 limbs.  The <code>SQR</code> threshold is usually about twice the <code>MUL</code>.

   <p>The basecase algorithm will take a time of the form M(N) = a*N^2 + b*N + c and the Karatsuba algorithm K(N) = 3*M(N/2) + d*N + e, which expands to K(N) = 3/4*a*N^2 + 3/2*b*N + 3*c + d*N + e.  The
factor 3/4 for a means per-crossproduct speedups in the
basecase code will increase the threshold since they benefit M(N) more
than K(N).  And conversely the 3/2 for b means
linear style speedups of b will increase the threshold since they
benefit K(N) more than M(N).  The latter can be seen for
instance when adding an optimized <code>mpn_sqr_diagonal</code> to
<code>mpn_sqr_basecase</code>.  Of course all speedups reduce total time, and in
that sense the algorithm thresholds are merely of academic interest.
