<h4 class="subsection">15.7.2 Factorial</h4>

<p><a name="index-Factorial-algorithm-927"></a>
Factorials are calculated by a combination of two algorithms. An idea is
shared among them: to compute the odd part of the factorial; a final step
takes account of the power of 2 term, by shifting.

   <p>For small n, the odd factor of n! is computed with the simple
observation that it is equal to the product of all positive odd numbers
smaller than n times the odd factor of [n/2]!,
where [x] is the integer part of x, and so on
recursively. The procedure can be best illustrated with an example,

   <blockquote>
23! = (23.21.19.17.15.13.11.9.7.5.3)(11.9.7.5.3)(5.3)2^19
</blockquote>

   <p>Current code collects all the factors in a single list, with a loop and no
recursion, and compute the product, with no special care for repeated chunks.

   <p>When n is larger, computation pass trough prime sieving. An helper
function is used, as suggested by Peter Luschny:

<pre class="example">                                 n
                               -----
                    n!          | |   L(p,n)
     msf(n) = -------------- =  | |  p
               [n/2]!^2.2^k     p=3
</pre>
   <p>Where p ranges on odd prime numbers. The exponent k is chosen to
obtain an odd integer number: k is the number of 1 bits in the binary
representation of [n/2]. The function L(p,n)
can be defined as zero when p is composite, and, for any prime
p, it is computed with:

<pre class="example">               ---
                \    n
     L(p,n) =   /  [---] mod 2   &lt;=  log (n) .
               ---  p^i                p
               i&gt;0
</pre>
   <p>With this helper function, we are able to compute the odd part of n! 
using the recursion implied by n!=[n/2]!^2*msf(n)*2^k. The recursion stops using the
small-n algorithm on some [n/2^i].

   <p>Both the above algorithms use binary splitting to compute the product of many
small factors. At first as many products as possible are accumulated in a
single register, generating a list of factors that fit in a machine word. This
list is then split into halves, and the product is computed recursively.

   <p>Such splitting is more efficient than repeated Nx1 multiplies since it
forms big multiplies, allowing Karatsuba and higher algorithms to be used. 
And even below the Karatsuba threshold a big block of work can be more
efficient for the basecase algorithm.
