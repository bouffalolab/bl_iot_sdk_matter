<h3 class="section">2.2 ABI and ISA</h3>

<p><a name="index-ABI-65"></a><a name="index-Application-Binary-Interface-66"></a><a name="index-ISA-67"></a><a name="index-Instruction-Set-Architecture-68"></a>
ABI (Application Binary Interface) refers to the calling conventions between
functions, meaning what registers are used and what sizes the various C data
types are.  ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) refers to the instructions and
registers a CPU has available.

   <p>Some 64-bit ISA CPUs have both a 64-bit ABI and a 32-bit ABI defined, the
latter for compatibility with older CPUs in the family.  GMP supports some
CPUs like this in both ABIs.  In fact within GMP &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI</span></samp>&rsquo; means a
combination of chip ABI, plus how GMP chooses to use it.  For example in some
32-bit ABIs, GMP may support a limb as either a 32-bit <code>long</code> or a 64-bit
<code>long long</code>.

   <p>By default GMP chooses the best ABI available for a given system, and this
generally gives significantly greater speed.  But an ABI can be chosen
explicitly to make GMP compatible with other libraries, or particular
application requirements.  For example,

<pre class="example">     ./configure ABI=32
</pre>
   <p>In all cases it's vital that all object code used in a given program is
compiled for the same ABI.

   <p>Usually a limb is implemented as a <code>long</code>.  When a <code>long long</code> limb
is used this is encoded in the generated <samp><span class="file">gmp.h</span></samp>.  This is convenient for
applications, but it does mean that <samp><span class="file">gmp.h</span></samp> will vary, and can't be just
copied around.  <samp><span class="file">gmp.h</span></samp> remains compiler independent though, since all
compilers for a particular ABI will be expected to use the same limb type.

   <p>Currently no attempt is made to follow whatever conventions a system has for
installing library or header files built for a particular ABI.  This will
probably only matter when installing multiple builds of GMP, and it might be
as simple as configuring with a special &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libdir</span></samp>&rsquo;, or it might require
more than that.  Note that builds for different ABIs need to done separately,
with a fresh <samp><span class="command">./configure</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> each.

<dt>AMD64 (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo;)<dd><a name="index-AMD64-69"></a>On AMD64 systems supporting both 32-bit and 64-bit modes for applications, the
following ABI choices are available.

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=64</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The 64-bit ABI uses 64-bit limbs and pointers and makes full use of the chip
architecture.  This is the default.  Applications will usually not need
special compiler flags, but for reference the option is

          <pre class="example">               gcc  -m64
</pre>
          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=32</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The 32-bit ABI is the usual i386 conventions.  This will be slower, and is not
recommended except for inter-operating with other code not yet 64-bit capable. 
Applications must be compiled with

          <pre class="example">               gcc  -m32
</pre>
          <p>(In GCC 2.95 and earlier there's no &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m32</span></samp>&rsquo; option, it's the only mode.)

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=x32</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The x32 ABI uses 64-bit limbs but 32-bit pointers.  Like the 64-bit ABI, it
makes full use of the chip's arithmetic capabilities.  This ABI is not
supported by all operating systems.

          <pre class="example">               gcc  -mx32

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=2.0w</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The 2.0w ABI uses 64-bit limbs and pointers and is available on HP-UX 11 or
up.  Applications must be compiled with

          <pre class="example">               gcc [built for 2.0w]
               cc  +DD64
</pre>
          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=2.0n</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The 2.0n ABI means the 32-bit HPPA 1.0 ABI and all its normal calling
conventions, but with 64-bit instructions permitted within functions.  GMP
uses a 64-bit <code>long long</code> for a limb.  This ABI is available on hppa64
GNU/Linux and on HP-UX 10 or higher.  Applications must be compiled with

          <pre class="example">               gcc [built for 2.0n]
               cc  +DA2.0 +e
</pre>
          <p>Note that current versions of GCC (eg. 3.2) don't generate 64-bit
instructions for <code>long long</code> operations and so may be slower than for
2.0w.  (The GMP assembly code is the same though.)

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=1.0</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>HPPA 2.0 CPUs can run all HPPA 1.0 and 1.1 code in the 32-bit HPPA 1.0 ABI. 
No special compiler options are needed for applications. 
</dl>

     <p>All three ABIs are available for CPU types &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hppa2.0w</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hppa2.0</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hppa64</span></samp>&rsquo;, but for CPU type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hppa2.0n</span></samp>&rsquo; only 2.0n or 1.0 are
considered.

     <p>Note that GCC on HP-UX has no options to choose between 2.0n and 2.0w modes,
unlike HP <samp><span class="command">cc</span></samp>.  Instead it must be built for one or the other ABI. 
GMP will detect how it was built, and skip to the corresponding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI</span></samp>&rsquo;.

GMP performance is the same in both.

<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=32</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>In the 32-bit ABI, pointers, <code>int</code>s and <code>long</code>s are 32 bits and GMP
uses a 64 bit <code>long long</code> for a limb.  Applications can be compiled
without any special flags since this ABI is the default in both HP C and GCC,
but for reference the flags are

          <pre class="example">               gcc  -milp32
               cc   +DD32
</pre>
          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=64</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>In the 64-bit ABI, <code>long</code>s and pointers are 64 bits and GMP uses a

               cc   +DD64
</pre>
          </dl>

     <p>On other IA-64 systems, GNU/Linux for instance, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=64</span></samp>&rsquo; is the only
choice.

and 64.  n32 or 64 are recommended, and GMP performance will be the same in
each.  The default is n32.

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=o32</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The o32 ABI is 32-bit pointers and integers, and no 64-bit operations.  GMP
will be slower than in n32 or 64, this option only exists to support old
compilers, eg. GCC 2.7.2.  Applications can be compiled with no special
flags on an old compiler, or on a newer compiler with

          <pre class="example">               gcc  -mabi=32
               cc   -32
</pre>
          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=n32</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The n32 ABI is 32-bit pointers and integers, but with a 64-bit limb using a
<code>long long</code>.  Applications must be compiled with

          <pre class="example">               gcc  -mabi=n32
               cc   -n32
</pre>
          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=64</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The 64-bit ABI is 64-bit pointers and integers.  Applications must be compiled

               cc   -64
</pre>
          </dl>

     <p>Note that MIPS GNU/Linux, as of kernel version 2.2, doesn't have the necessary
support for n32 or 64 and so only gets a 32-bit limb and the MIPS 2 code.

          <p>On 64-bit GNU/Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X/Darwin systems, the applications must

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=mode32</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mode32</span></samp>&rsquo; ABI uses a 64-bit <code>long long</code> limb but with the chip
still in 32-bit mode and using 32-bit calling conventions.  This is the default
for systems where the true 64-bit ABI is unavailable.  No special compiler
options are typically needed for applications.  This ABI is not available under
AIX.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=32</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This is the basic 32-bit PowerPC ABI, with a 32-bit limb.  No special compiler

     <p>GMP's speed is greatest for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mode64</span></samp>&rsquo; ABI, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mode32</span></samp>&rsquo; ABI is 2nd
best.  In &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=32</span></samp>&rsquo; only the 32-bit ISA is used and this doesn't make full
use of a 64-bit chip.

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=64</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The 64-bit V9 ABI is available on the various BSD sparc64 ports, recent
versions of Sparc64 GNU/Linux, and Solaris 2.7 and up (when the kernel is in
64-bit mode).  GCC 3.2 or higher, or Sun <samp><span class="command">cc</span></samp> is required.  On
GNU/Linux, depending on the default <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> mode, applications must be
compiled with

          <pre class="example">               gcc  -m64
</pre>
          <p>On Solaris applications must be compiled with

               cc   -xarch=v9
</pre>
          <p>On the BSD sparc64 systems no special options are required, since 64-bits is
the only ABI available.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=32</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>For the basic 32-bit ABI, GMP still uses as much of the V9 ISA as it can.  In
the Sun documentation this combination is known as &ldquo;v8plus&rdquo;.  On GNU/Linux,
depending on the default <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> mode, applications may need to be
compiled with

          <pre class="example">               gcc  -m32
</pre>
          <p>On Solaris, no special compiler options are required for applications, though
using something like the following is recommended.  (<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> 2.8 and
earlier only support &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-mv8</span></samp>&rsquo; though.)

          <pre class="example">               gcc  -mv8plus

</pre>
          </dl>

     <p>GMP speed is greatest in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=64</span></samp>&rsquo;, so it's the default where available. 
The speed is partly because there are extra registers available and partly
because 64-bits is considered the more important case and has therefore had
better code written for it.

     <p>Don't be confused by the names of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-m</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-x</span></samp>&rsquo; compiler
options, they're called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">arch</span></samp>&rsquo; but effectively control both ABI and ISA.

     <p>On Solaris 2.6 and earlier, only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=32</span></samp>&rsquo; is available since the kernel
doesn't save all registers.

     <p>On Solaris 2.7 with the kernel in 32-bit mode, a normal native build will
reject &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=64</span></samp>&rsquo; because the resulting executables won't run. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=64</span></samp>&rsquo; can still be built if desired by making it look like a
cross-compile, for example

     <pre class="example">          ./configure --build=none --host=sparcv9-sun-solaris2.7 ABI=64
</pre>
     </dl>
