<h3 class="section">3.13 Profiling</h3>

<p><a name="index-Profiling-229"></a><a name="index-Execution-profiling-230"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002denable_002dprofiling_007d-231"></a>
Running a program under a profiler is a good way to find where it's spending
most time and where improvements can be best sought.  The profiling choices
for a GMP build are as follows.

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--disable-profiling</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The default is to add nothing special for profiling.

     <p>It should be possible to just compile the mainline of a program with <code>-p</code>
and use <samp><span class="command">prof</span></samp> to get a profile consisting of timer-based sampling of
the program counter.  Most of the GMP assembly code has the necessary symbol
information.

     <p>This approach has the advantage of minimizing interference with normal program
operation, but on most systems the resolution of the sampling is quite low (10
milliseconds for instance), requiring long runs to get accurate information.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--enable-profiling=prof</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bprof_007d-232"></a>Build with support for the system <samp><span class="command">prof</span></samp>, which means &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; added
to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CFLAGS</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>This provides call counting in addition to program counter sampling, which
allows the most frequently called routines to be identified, and an average
time spent in each routine to be determined.

     <p>The x86 assembly code has support for this option, but on other processors
the assembly routines will be as if compiled without &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; and therefore
won't appear in the call counts.

     <p>On some systems, such as GNU/Linux, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo; in fact means &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-pg</span></samp>&rsquo; and in
this case &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--enable-profiling=gprof</span></samp>&rsquo; described below should be used
instead.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--enable-profiling=gprof</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bgprof_007d-233"></a>Build with support for <samp><span class="command">gprof</span></samp>, which means &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-pg</span></samp>&rsquo; added to the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CFLAGS</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>This provides call graph construction in addition to call counting and program
counter sampling, which makes it possible to count calls coming from different
locations.  For example the number of calls to <code>mpn_mul</code> from
<code>mpz_mul</code> versus the number from <code>mpf_mul</code>.  The program counter
sampling is still flat though, so only a total time in <code>mpn_mul</code> would be
accumulated, not a separate amount for each call site.

     <p>The x86 assembly code has support for this option, but on other processors
the assembly routines will be as if compiled without &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-pg</span></samp>&rsquo; and therefore
not be included in the call counts.

     <p>On x86 and m68k systems &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-pg</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-fomit-frame-pointer</span></samp>&rsquo; are
incompatible, so the latter is omitted from the default flags in that case,
which might result in poorer code generation.

     <p>Incidentally, it should be possible to use the <samp><span class="command">gprof</span></samp> program with a
plain &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--enable-profiling=prof</span></samp>&rsquo; build.  But in that case only the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gprof -p</span></samp>&rsquo; flat profile and call counts can be expected to be valid, not
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gprof -q</span></samp>&rsquo; call graph.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--enable-profiling=instrument</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002dfinstrument_002dfunctions_007d-234"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binstrument_002dfunctions_007d-235"></a>Build with the GCC option &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-finstrument-functions</span></samp>&rsquo; added to the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CFLAGS</span></samp>&rsquo; (see <a href="../gcc/Code-Gen-Options.html#Code-Gen-Options">Options for Code Generation</a>).

     <p>This inserts special instrumenting calls at the start and end of each
function, allowing exact timing and full call graph construction.

     <p>This instrumenting is not normally a standard system feature and will require
support from an external library, such as

     <p><a name="index-FunctionCheck-236"></a><a name="index-fnccheck-237"></a>
     <pre class="display">          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fnccheck/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/fnccheck/</a>
</pre>
     <p>This should be included in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LIBS</span></samp>&rsquo; during the GMP configure so that test
programs will link.  For example,

     <pre class="example">          ./configure --enable-profiling=instrument LIBS=-lfc
</pre>
     <p>On a GNU system the C library provides dummy instrumenting functions, so
programs compiled with this option will link.  In this case it's only
necessary to ensure the correct library is added when linking an application.

     <p>The x86 assembly code supports this option, but on other processors the
assembly routines will be as if compiled without
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-finstrument-functions</span></samp>&rsquo; meaning time spent in them will effectively be
attributed to their caller.
