<h4 class="subsection">15.8.5 Functional Units</h4>

<p>When choosing an approach for an assembly loop, consideration is given to
what operations can execute simultaneously and what throughput can thereby be
achieved.  In some cases an algorithm can be tweaked to accommodate available
resources.

   <p>Loop control will generally require a counter and pointer updates, costing as
much as 5 instructions, plus any delays a branch introduces.  CPU addressing
modes might reduce pointer updates, perhaps by allowing just one updating
pointer and others expressed as offsets from it, or on CISC chips with all
addressing done with the loop counter as a scaled index.

   <p>The final loop control cost can be amortised by processing several limbs in
each iteration (see <a href="Assembly-Loop-Unrolling.html#Assembly-Loop-Unrolling">Assembly Loop Unrolling</a>).  This at least ensures loop
control isn't a big fraction the work done.

   <p>Memory throughput is always a limit.  If perhaps only one load or one store
can be done per cycle then 3 cycles/limb will the top speed for &ldquo;binary&rdquo;
operations like <code>mpn_add_n</code>, and any code achieving that is optimal.

   <p>Integer resources can be freed up by having the loop counter in a float
register, or by pressing the float units into use for some multiplying,
perhaps doing every second limb on the float side (see <a href="Assembly-Floating-Point.html#Assembly-Floating-Point">Assembly Floating Point</a>).

   <p>Float resources can be freed up by doing carry propagation on the integer
side, or even by doing integer to float conversions in integers using bit
twiddling.
