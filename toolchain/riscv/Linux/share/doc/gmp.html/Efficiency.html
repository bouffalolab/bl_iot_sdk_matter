<h3 class="section">3.11 Efficiency</h3>

<p><a name="index-Efficiency-202"></a>
     <dl>
<dt>Small Operands<dd><a name="index-Small-operands-203"></a>On small operands, the time for function call overheads and memory allocation
can be significant in comparison to actual calculation.  This is unavoidable
in a general purpose variable precision library, although GMP attempts to be
as efficient as it can on both large and small operands.

     <br><dt>Static Linking<dd><a name="index-Static-linking-204"></a>On some CPUs, in particular the x86s, the static <samp><span class="file">libgmp.a</span></samp> should be
used for maximum speed, since the PIC code in the shared <samp><span class="file">libgmp.so</span></samp> will
have a small overhead on each function call and global data address.  For many
programs this will be insignificant, but for long calculations there's a gain
to be had.

     <br><dt>Initializing and Clearing<dd><a name="index-Initializing-and-clearing-205"></a>Avoid excessive initializing and clearing of variables, since this can be
quite time consuming, especially in comparison to otherwise fast operations
like addition.

     <p>A language interpreter might want to keep a free list or stack of
initialized variables ready for use.  It should be possible to integrate
something like that with a garbage collector too.

     <br><dt>Reallocations<dd><a name="index-Reallocations-206"></a>An <code>mpz_t</code> or <code>mpq_t</code> variable used to hold successively increasing
values will have its memory repeatedly <code>realloc</code>ed, which could be quite
slow or could fragment memory, depending on the C library.  If an application
can estimate the final size then <code>mpz_init2</code> or <code>mpz_realloc2</code> can
be called to allocate the necessary space from the beginning
(see <a href="Initializing-Integers.html#Initializing-Integers">Initializing Integers</a>).

     <p>It doesn't matter if a size set with <code>mpz_init2</code> or <code>mpz_realloc2</code>
is too small, since all functions will do a further reallocation if necessary. 
Badly overestimating memory required will waste space though.

     <br><dt><code>2exp</code> Functions<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b2exp_007d-functions-207"></a>It's up to an application to call functions like <code>mpz_mul_2exp</code> when
appropriate.  General purpose functions like <code>mpz_mul</code> make no attempt to
identify powers of two or other special forms, because such inputs will
usually be very rare and testing every time would be wasteful.

     <br><dt><code>ui</code> and <code>si</code> Functions<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bui_007d-and-_0040code_007bsi_007d-functions-208"></a>The <code>ui</code> functions and the small number of <code>si</code> functions exist for
convenience and should be used where applicable.  But if for example an
<code>mpz_t</code> contains a value that fits in an <code>unsigned long</code> there's no
need extract it and call a <code>ui</code> function, just use the regular <code>mpz</code>
function.

     <br><dt>In-Place Operations<dd><a name="index-In_002dplace-operations-209"></a><code>mpz_abs</code>, <code>mpq_abs</code>, <code>mpf_abs</code>, <code>mpz_neg</code>, <code>mpq_neg</code>
and <code>mpf_neg</code> are fast when used for in-place operations like
<code>mpz_abs(x,x)</code>, since in the current implementation only a single field
of <code>x</code> needs changing.  On suitable compilers (GCC for instance) this is
inlined too.

     <p><code>mpz_add_ui</code>, <code>mpz_sub_ui</code>, <code>mpf_add_ui</code> and <code>mpf_sub_ui</code>
benefit from an in-place operation like <code>mpz_add_ui(x,x,y)</code>, since
usually only one or two limbs of <code>x</code> will need to be changed.  The same
applies to the full precision <code>mpz_add</code> etc if <code>y</code> is small.  If
<code>y</code> is big then cache locality may be helped, but that's all.

     <p><code>mpz_mul</code> is currently the opposite, a separate destination is slightly
better.  A call like <code>mpz_mul(x,x,y)</code> will, unless <code>y</code> is only one
limb, make a temporary copy of <code>x</code> before forming the result.  Normally
that copying will only be a tiny fraction of the time for the multiply, so
this is not a particularly important consideration.

     <p><code>mpz_set</code>, <code>mpq_set</code>, <code>mpq_set_num</code>, <code>mpf_set</code>, etc, make
no attempt to recognise a copy of something to itself, so a call like
<code>mpz_set(x,x)</code> will be wasteful.  Naturally that would never be written
deliberately, but if it might arise from two pointers to the same object then
a test to avoid it might be desirable.

     <pre class="example">          if (x != y)
            mpz_set (x, y);
</pre>
     <p>Note that it's never worth introducing extra <code>mpz_set</code> calls just to get
in-place operations.  If a result should go to a particular variable then just
direct it there and let GMP take care of data movement.

     <br><dt>Divisibility Testing (Small Integers)<dd><a name="index-Divisibility-testing-210"></a><code>mpz_divisible_ui_p</code> and <code>mpz_congruent_ui_p</code> are the best functions
for testing whether an <code>mpz_t</code> is divisible by an individual small
integer.  They use an algorithm which is faster than <code>mpz_tdiv_ui</code>, but
which gives no useful information about the actual remainder, only whether
it's zero (or a particular value).

     <p>However when testing divisibility by several small integers, it's best to take
a remainder modulo their product, to save multi-precision operations.  For
instance to test whether a number is divisible by any of 23, 29 or 31 take a
remainder modulo 23*29*31 = 20677 and then test that.

     <p>The division functions like <code>mpz_tdiv_q_ui</code> which give a quotient as well
as a remainder are generally a little slower than the remainder-only functions
like <code>mpz_tdiv_ui</code>.  If the quotient is only rarely wanted then it's
probably best to just take a remainder and then go back and calculate the
quotient if and when it's wanted (<code>mpz_divexact_ui</code> can be used if the
remainder is zero).

     <br><dt>Rational Arithmetic<dd><a name="index-Rational-arithmetic-211"></a>The <code>mpq</code> functions operate on <code>mpq_t</code> values with no common factors
in the numerator and denominator.  Common factors are checked-for and cast out
as necessary.  In general, cancelling factors every time is the best approach
since it minimizes the sizes for subsequent operations.

     <p>However, applications that know something about the factorization of the
values they're working with might be able to avoid some of the GCDs used for
canonicalization, or swap them for divisions.  For example when multiplying by
a prime it's enough to check for factors of it in the denominator instead of
doing a full GCD.  Or when forming a big product it might be known that very
little cancellation will be possible, and so canonicalization can be left to
the end.

     <p>The <code>mpq_numref</code> and <code>mpq_denref</code> macros give access to the
numerator and denominator to do things outside the scope of the supplied
<code>mpq</code> functions.  See <a href="Applying-Integer-Functions.html#Applying-Integer-Functions">Applying Integer Functions</a>.

     <p>The canonical form for rationals allows mixed-type <code>mpq_t</code> and integer
additions or subtractions to be done directly with multiples of the
denominator.  This will be somewhat faster than <code>mpq_add</code>.  For example,

     <pre class="example">          /* mpq increment */
          mpz_add (mpq_numref(q), mpq_numref(q), mpq_denref(q));
          
          /* mpq += unsigned long */
          mpz_addmul_ui (mpq_numref(q), mpq_denref(q), 123UL);
          
          /* mpq -= mpz */
          mpz_submul (mpq_numref(q), mpq_denref(q), z);
</pre>
     <br><dt>Number Sequences<dd><a name="index-Number-sequences-212"></a>Functions like <code>mpz_fac_ui</code>, <code>mpz_fib_ui</code> and <code>mpz_bin_uiui</code>
are designed for calculating isolated values.  If a range of values is wanted
it's probably best to call to get a starting point and iterate from there.

     <br><dt>Text Input/Output<dd><a name="index-Text-input_002foutput-213"></a>Hexadecimal or octal are suggested for input or output in text form. 
Power-of-2 bases like these can be converted much more efficiently than other
bases, like decimal.  For big numbers there's usually nothing of particular
interest to be seen in the digits, so the base doesn't matter much.

     <p>Maybe we can hope octal will one day become the normal base for everyday use,
as proposed by King Charles XII of Sweden and later reformers.
