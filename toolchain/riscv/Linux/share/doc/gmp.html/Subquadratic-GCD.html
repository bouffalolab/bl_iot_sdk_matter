<h4 class="subsection">15.3.3 Subquadratic GCD</h4>

<p>For inputs larger than <code>GCD_DC_THRESHOLD</code>, GCD is computed via the HGCD
(Half GCD) function, as a generalization to Lehmer's algorithm.

   <p>Let the inputs a,b be of size N limbs each. Put S = floor(N/2) + 1. Then HGCD(a,b) returns a transformation
matrix T with non-negative elements, and reduced numbers (c;d) =
T^-1 (a;b). The reduced numbers c,d must be larger than S
limbs, while their difference abs(c-d) must fit in S limbs. The
matrix elements will also be of size roughly N/2.

   <p>The HGCD base case uses Lehmer's algorithm, but with the above stop condition
that returns reduced numbers and the corresponding transformation matrix
half-way through. For inputs larger than <code>HGCD_THRESHOLD</code>, HGCD is
computed recursively, using the divide and conquer algorithm in &ldquo;On
Sch&ouml;nhage's algorithm and subquadratic integer GCD computation&rdquo; by M&ouml;ller
(see <a href="References.html#References">References</a>). The recursive algorithm consists of these main
steps.

     <ul>
<li>Call HGCD recursively, on the most significant N/2 limbs. Apply the
resulting matrix T_1 to the full numbers, reducing them to a size just
above 3N/2.

     <li>Perform a small number of division or subtraction steps to reduce the numbers
to size below 3N/2. This is essential mainly for the unlikely case of
large quotients.

     <li>Call HGCD recursively, on the most significant N/2 limbs of the reduced
numbers. Apply the resulting matrix T_2 to the full numbers, reducing
them to a size just above N/2.

     <li>Compute T = T_1 T_2.

     <li>Perform a small number of division and subtraction steps to satisfy the
requirements, and return. 
</ul>

   <p>GCD is then implemented as a loop around HGCD, similarly to Lehmer's
algorithm. Where Lehmer repeatedly chops off the top two limbs, calls
<code>mpn_hgcd2</code>, and applies the resulting matrix to the full numbers, the
sub-quadratic GCD chops off the most significant third of the limbs (the
proportion is a tuning parameter, and 1/3 seems to be more efficient
than, e.g, 1/2), calls <code>mpn_hgcd</code>, and applies the resulting
matrix. Once the input numbers are reduced to size below
<code>GCD_DC_THRESHOLD</code>, Lehmer's algorithm is used for the rest of the work.

   <p>The asymptotic running time of both HGCD and GCD is O(M(N)*log(N)),
where M(N) is the time for multiplying two N-limb numbers.
