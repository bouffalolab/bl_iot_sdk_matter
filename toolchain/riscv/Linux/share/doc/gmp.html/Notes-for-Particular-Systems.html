<!-- scratching their head.  Fun with different ABIs on a system belongs in the -->
<!-- above section. -->

     <dt>AIX 3 and 4<dd><a name="index-AIX-88"></a>On systems &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*-*-aix[34]*</span></samp>&rsquo; shared libraries are disabled by default, since
some versions of the native <samp><span class="command">ar</span></samp> fail on the convenience libraries
used.  A shared build can be attempted with

     <pre class="example">          ./configure --enable-shared --disable-static
</pre>
     <p>Note that the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--disable-static</span></samp>&rsquo; is necessary because in a shared build
libtool makes <samp><span class="file">libgmp.a</span></samp> a symlink to <samp><span class="file">libgmp.so</span></samp>, apparently for
the benefit of old versions of <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> which only recognise <samp><span class="file">.a</span></samp>,
but unfortunately this is done even if a fully functional <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> is
available.

     <br><dt>ARM<dd><a name="index-ARM-89"></a>On systems &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">arm*-*-*</span></samp>&rsquo;, versions of GCC up to and including 2.95.3 have a
bug in unsigned division, giving wrong results for some operands.  GMP
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./configure</span></samp>&rsquo; will demand GCC 2.95.4 or later.

     <br><dt>Compaq C++<dd><a name="index-Compaq-C_002b_002b-90"></a>Compaq C++ on OSF 5.1 has two flavours of <code>iostream</code>, a standard one and
an old pre-standard one (see &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">man iostream_intro</span></samp>&rsquo;).  GMP can only use the
standard one, which unfortunately is not the default but must be selected by
defining <code>__USE_STD_IOSTREAM</code>.  Configure with for instance

     <pre class="example">          ./configure --enable-cxx CPPFLAGS=-D__USE_STD_IOSTREAM
</pre>
     <br><dt>Floating Point Mode<dd><a name="index-Floating-point-mode-91"></a><a name="index-Hardware-floating-point-mode-92"></a><a name="index-Precision-of-hardware-floating-point-93"></a><a name="index-x87-94"></a>On some systems, the hardware floating point has a control mode which can set
all operations to be done in a particular precision, for instance single,
double or extended on x86 systems (x87 floating point).  The GMP functions
involving a <code>double</code> cannot be expected to operate to their full
precision when the hardware is in single precision mode.  Of course this
affects all code, including application code, not just GMP.

     <br><dt>FreeBSD 7.x, 8.x, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2<dd><a name="index-FreeBSD-95"></a><samp><span class="command">m4</span></samp> in these releases of FreeBSD has an eval function which ignores
its 2nd and 3rd arguments, which makes it unsuitable for <samp><span class="file">.asm</span></samp> file
processing.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./configure</span></samp>&rsquo; will detect the problem and either abort or
choose another m4 in the <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.  The bug is fixed in FreeBSD 9.3 and 10.0,
so either upgrade or use GNU m4.  Note that the FreeBSD package system installs
GNU m4 under the name &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gm4</span></samp>&rsquo;, which GMP cannot guess.

     <br><dt>FreeBSD 7.x, 8.x, 9.x<dd><a name="index-FreeBSD-96"></a>GMP releases starting with 6.0 do not support &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=32</span></samp>&rsquo; on FreeBSD/amd64
prior to release 10.0 of the system.  The cause is a broken <code>limits.h</code>,
which GMP no longer works around.

     <br><dt>MS-DOS and MS Windows<dd><a name="index-MS_002dDOS-97"></a><a name="index-MS-Windows-98"></a><a name="index-Windows-99"></a><a name="index-Cygwin-100"></a><a name="index-DJGPP-101"></a><a name="index-MINGW-102"></a>On an MS-DOS system DJGPP can be used to build GMP, and on an MS Windows
system Cygwin, DJGPP and MINGW can be used.  All three are excellent ports of
GCC and the various GNU tools.

     <pre class="display">          <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>
          <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/</a>
          <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">http://www.mingw.org/</a>
</pre>
     <p><a name="index-Interix-103"></a><a name="index-Services-for-Unix-104"></a>Microsoft also publishes an Interix &ldquo;Services for Unix&rdquo; which can be used to
build GMP on Windows (with a normal &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./configure</span></samp>&rsquo;), but it's not free
software.

     <br><dt>MS Windows DLLs<dd><a name="index-DLLs-105"></a><a name="index-MS-Windows-106"></a><a name="index-Windows-107"></a>On systems &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*-*-cygwin*</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*-*-mingw*</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*-*-pw32*</span></samp>&rsquo; by
default GMP builds only a static library, but a DLL can be built instead using

     <pre class="example">          ./configure --disable-static --enable-shared
</pre>
     <p>Static and DLL libraries can't both be built, since certain export directives
in <samp><span class="file">gmp.h</span></samp> must be different.

     <p>A MINGW DLL build of GMP can be used with Microsoft C.  Libtool doesn't
install a <samp><span class="file">.lib</span></samp> format import library, but it can be created with MS
<samp><span class="command">lib</span></samp> as follows, and copied to the install directory.  Similarly for
<samp><span class="file">libmp</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">libgmpxx</span></samp>.

     <pre class="example">          cd .libs
          lib /def:libgmp-3.dll.def /out:libgmp-3.lib
</pre>
     <p>MINGW uses the C runtime library &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">msvcrt.dll</span></samp>&rsquo; for I/O, so applications
wanting to use the GMP I/O routines must be compiled with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cl /MD</span></samp>&rsquo; to do
the same.  If one of the other C runtime library choices provided by MS C is
desired then the suggestion is to use the GMP string functions and confine I/O
to the application.

     <br><dt>Motorola 68k CPU Types<dd><a name="index-g_t68000-108"></a>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m68k</span></samp>&rsquo; is taken to mean 68000.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m68020</span></samp>&rsquo; or higher will give a
performance boost on applicable CPUs.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m68360</span></samp>&rsquo; can be used for CPU32
series chips.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m68302</span></samp>&rsquo; can be used for &ldquo;Dragonball&rdquo; series chips,
though this is merely a synonym for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m68000</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt>NetBSD 5.x<dd><a name="index-NetBSD-109"></a><samp><span class="command">m4</span></samp> in these releases of NetBSD has an eval function which ignores its
2nd and 3rd arguments, which makes it unsuitable for <samp><span class="file">.asm</span></samp> file
processing.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./configure</span></samp>&rsquo; will detect the problem and either abort or
choose another m4 in the <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.  The bug is fixed in NetBSD 6, so either
upgrade or use GNU m4.  Note that the NetBSD package system installs GNU m4
under the name &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gm4</span></samp>&rsquo;, which GMP cannot guess.

     <br><dt>OpenBSD 2.6<dd><a name="index-OpenBSD-110"></a><samp><span class="command">m4</span></samp> in this release of OpenBSD has a bug in <code>eval</code> that makes it
unsuitable for <samp><span class="file">.asm</span></samp> file processing.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./configure</span></samp>&rsquo; will detect
the problem and either abort or choose another m4 in the <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.  The bug
is fixed in OpenBSD 2.7, so either upgrade or use GNU m4.

     <br><dt>Power CPU Types<dd><a name="index-Power_002fPowerPC-111"></a>In GMP, CPU types &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">power*</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">powerpc*</span></samp>&rsquo; will each use instructions
not available on the other, so it's important to choose the right one for the
CPU that will be used.  Currently GMP has no assembly code support for using
just the common instruction subset.  To get executables that run on both, the
current suggestion is to use the generic C code (<samp><span class="option">--disable-assembly</span></samp>),
possibly with appropriate compiler options (like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-mcpu=common</span></samp>&rsquo; for
<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>).  CPU &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rs6000</span></samp>&rsquo; (which is not a CPU but a family of
workstations) is accepted by <samp><span class="file">config.sub</span></samp>, but is currently equivalent to
<samp><span class="option">--disable-assembly</span></samp>.

     <br><dt>Sparc CPU Types<dd><a name="index-Sparc-112"></a>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sparcv8</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">supersparc</span></samp>&rsquo; on relevant systems will give a
significant performance increase over the V7 code selected by plain
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sparc</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt>Sparc App Regs<dd><a name="index-Sparc-113"></a>The GMP assembly code for both 32-bit and 64-bit Sparc clobbers the
&ldquo;application registers&rdquo; <code>g2</code>, <code>g3</code> and <code>g4</code>, the same way
that the GCC default &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-mapp-regs</span></samp>&rsquo; does (see <a href="../gcc/SPARC-Options.html#SPARC-Options">SPARC Options</a>).

     <p>This makes that code unsuitable for use with the special V9
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-mcmodel=embmedany</span></samp>&rsquo; (which uses <code>g4</code> as a data segment pointer), and
for applications wanting to use those registers for special purposes.  In these
cases the only suggestion currently is to build GMP with
<samp><span class="option">--disable-assembly</span></samp> to avoid the assembly code.

     <br><dt>SunOS 4<dd><a name="index-SunOS-114"></a><samp><span class="command">/usr/bin/m4</span></samp> lacks various features needed to process <samp><span class="file">.asm</span></samp>
files, and instead &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./configure</span></samp>&rsquo; will automatically use
<samp><span class="command">/usr/5bin/m4</span></samp>, which we believe is always available (if not then use
GNU m4).

     <br><dt>x86 CPU Types<dd><a name="index-x86-115"></a><a name="index-g_t80x86-116"></a><a name="index-i386-117"></a>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i586</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pentium</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pentiummmx</span></samp>&rsquo; code is good for its intended
P5 Pentium chips, but quite slow when run on Intel P6 class chips (PPro, P-II,
P-III).  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i386</span></samp>&rsquo; is a better choice when making binaries that must run on
both.

     <br><dt>x86 MMX and SSE2 Code<dd><a name="index-MMX-118"></a><a name="index-SSE2-119"></a>If the CPU selected has MMX code but the assembler doesn't support it, a
warning is given and non-MMX code is used instead.  This will be an inferior
build, since the MMX code that's present is there because it's faster than the
corresponding plain integer code.  The same applies to SSE2.

     <p>Old versions of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gas</span></samp>&rsquo; don't support MMX instructions, in particular
version 1.92.3 that comes with FreeBSD 2.2.8 or the more recent OpenBSD 3.1
doesn't.

     <p>Solaris 2.6 and 2.7 <samp><span class="command">as</span></samp> generate incorrect object code for register
to register <code>movq</code> instructions, and so can't be used for MMX code. 
Install a recent <samp><span class="command">gas</span></samp> if MMX code is wanted on these systems.
