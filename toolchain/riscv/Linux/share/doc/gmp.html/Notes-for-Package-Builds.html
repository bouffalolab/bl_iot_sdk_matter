<h3 class="section">2.3 Notes for Package Builds</h3>

<p><a name="index-Build-notes-for-binary-packaging-81"></a><a name="index-Packaged-builds-82"></a>
GMP should present no great difficulties for packaging in a binary
distribution.

   <p><a name="index-Libtool-versioning-83"></a><a name="index-Shared-library-versioning-84"></a>Libtool is used to build the library and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-version-info</span></samp>&rsquo; is set
appropriately, having started from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3:0:0</span></samp>&rsquo; in GMP 3.0 (see <a href="../libtool/Versioning.html#Versioning">Library interface versions</a>).

   <p>The GMP 4 series will be upwardly binary compatible in each release and will
be upwardly binary compatible with all of the GMP 3 series.  Additional
function interfaces may be added in each release, so on systems where libtool
versioning is not fully checked by the loader an auxiliary mechanism may be
needed to express that a dynamic linked application depends on a new enough
GMP.

   <p>An auxiliary mechanism may also be needed to express that <samp><span class="file">libgmpxx.la</span></samp>
(from <samp><span class="option">--enable-cxx</span></samp>, see <a href="Build-Options.html#Build-Options">Build Options</a>) requires <samp><span class="file">libgmp.la</span></samp>
from the same GMP version, since this is not done by the libtool versioning,
nor otherwise.  A mismatch will result in unresolved symbols from the linker,
or perhaps the loader.

   <p>When building a package for a CPU family, care should be taken to use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--host</span></samp>&rsquo; (or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--build</span></samp>&rsquo;) to choose the least common denominator among
the CPUs which might use the package.  For example this might mean plain
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sparc</span></samp>&rsquo; (meaning V7) for SPARCs.

   <p>For x86s, <samp><span class="option">--enable-fat</span></samp> sets things up for a fat binary build, making a
runtime selection of optimized low level routines.  This is a good choice for
packaging to run on a range of x86 chips.

   <p>Users who care about speed will want GMP built for their exact CPU type, to
make best use of the available optimizations.  Providing a way to suitably
rebuild a package may be useful.  This could be as simple as making it
possible for a user to omit &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--build</span></samp>&rsquo; (and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--host</span></samp>&rsquo;) so
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./config.guess</span></samp>&rsquo; will detect the CPU.  But a way to manually specify a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--build</span></samp>&rsquo; will be wanted for systems where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./config.guess</span></samp>&rsquo; is
inexact.

   <p>On systems with multiple ABIs, a packaged build will need to decide which
among the choices is to be provided, see <a href="ABI-and-ISA.html#ABI-and-ISA">ABI and ISA</a>.  A given run of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./configure</span></samp>&rsquo; etc will only build one ABI.  If a second ABI is also
required then a second run of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./configure</span></samp>&rsquo; etc must be made, starting
from a clean directory tree (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make distclean</span></samp>&rsquo;).

   <p>As noted under &ldquo;ABI and ISA&rdquo;, currently no attempt is made to follow system
conventions for install locations that vary with ABI, such as
<samp><span class="file">/usr/lib/sparcv9</span></samp> for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=64</span></samp>&rsquo; as opposed to <samp><span class="file">/usr/lib</span></samp> for
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ABI=32</span></samp>&rsquo;.  A package build can override &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libdir</span></samp>&rsquo; and other standard
variables as necessary.

   <p>Note that <samp><span class="file">gmp.h</span></samp> is a generated file, and will be architecture and ABI
dependent.  When attempting to install two ABIs simultaneously it will be
important that an application compile gets the correct <samp><span class="file">gmp.h</span></samp> for its
desired ABI.  If compiler include paths don't vary with ABI options then it
might be necessary to create a <samp><span class="file">/usr/include/gmp.h</span></samp> which tests
preprocessor symbols and chooses the correct actual <samp><span class="file">gmp.h</span></samp>.
