<h4 class="subsection">15.5.1 Square Root</h4>

<p><a name="index-Square-root-algorithm-919"></a><a name="index-Karatsuba-square-root-algorithm-920"></a>
Square roots are taken using the &ldquo;Karatsuba Square Root&rdquo; algorithm by Paul
Zimmermann (see <a href="References.html#References">References</a>).

   <p>An input n is split into four parts of k bits each, so with
b=2^k we have n = a3*b^3 + a2*b^2
+ a1*b + a0.  Part a3 must be &ldquo;normalized&rdquo; so that either the high or
second highest bit is set.  In GMP, k is kept on a limb boundary and
the input is left shifted (by an even number of bits) to normalize.

   <p>The square root of the high two parts is taken, by recursive application of
the algorithm (bottoming out in a one-limb Newton's method),

<pre class="example">     s1,r1 = sqrtrem (a3*b + a2)
</pre>
   <p>This is an approximation to the desired root and is extended by a division to
give s,r,

<pre class="example">     q,u = divrem (r1*b + a1, 2*s1)
     s = s1*b + q
     r = u*b + a0 - q^2
</pre>
   <p>The normalization requirement on a3 means at this point s is
either correct or 1 too big.  r is negative in the latter case, so

<pre class="example">     if r &lt; 0 then
       r = r + 2*s - 1
       s = s - 1
</pre>
   <p>The algorithm is expressed in a divide and conquer form, but as noted in the
paper it can also be viewed as a discrete variant of Newton's method, or as a
variation on the schoolboy method (no longer taught) for square roots two
digits at a time.

   <p>If the remainder r is not required then usually only a few high limbs
of r and u need to be calculated to determine whether an
adjustment to s is required.  This optimization is not currently
implemented.

   <p>In the Karatsuba multiplication range this algorithm is O(1.5*M(N/2)), where M(n) is the time to multiply two numbers
of n limbs.  In the FFT multiplication range this grows to a bound of
O(6*M(N/2)).  In practice a factor of about 1.5 to 1.8 is
found in the Karatsuba and Toom-3 ranges, growing to 2 or 3 in the FFT range.

   <p>The algorithm does all its calculations in integers and the resulting
<code>mpn_sqrtrem</code> is used for both <code>mpz_sqrt</code> and <code>mpf_sqrt</code>. 
The extended precision given by <code>mpf_sqrt_ui</code> is obtained by
padding with zero limbs.
